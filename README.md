# Description
The SMRamp library provides a clean interface for controlling stepper motors using ramp mode.

The interface supports basic motion control functionality such as powering, homing, basic moves, and reading back status information. This significantly reduces development time for motion applications using stepper motors.

# Use Cases
The SMRamp functionality can be integrated into any project using a data structure and a function call.

For more documentation and examples, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/libraries/smramp.html

# Installation
To install using the Loupe Package Manager (LPM), in an initialized Automation Studio project directory run `lpm install smramp`. For more information about LPM, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/tools/lpm.html
